# GDPR Compliance Setup Guide for StitchesX

## What You Need to Do in Supabase

### 1. Run the GDPR Compliance SQL
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-gdpr-compliance.sql`
4. Click **Run** to execute all the GDPR compliance features

### 2. What This Sets Up

#### **GDPR Request Tracking**
- Tracks all data export, deletion, and rectification requests
- Stores request status and response data
- Provides audit trail for compliance

#### **Data Retention Management**
- Automatic cleanup of expired data based on your retention periods
- Logging of all data deletion activities
- Compliance monitoring functions

#### **User Data Export Function**
- `export_user_data(user_uuid)` - Exports all user data in JSON format
- Used by your `/api/gdpr-export` endpoint
- Complies with GDPR Article 15 (Right of Access)

#### **User Data Deletion Function**
- `delete_user_data(user_uuid)` - Completely removes user data
- Used by your delete account feature
- Complies with GDPR Article 17 (Right to Erasure)

#### **Data Anonymization Function**
- `anonymize_user_data(user_uuid)` - Anonymizes data for analytics
- Keeps data structure but removes personal information
- Useful for retaining business insights while protecting privacy

### 3. Automated Data Cleanup

The system will automatically delete data based on your retention periods:
- **User Activity**: 1 year
- **Anonymous Usage**: 1 year  
- **GDPR Requests**: 3 years
- **Support Communications**: 2 years

### 4. GDPR Compliance Dashboard

A view that shows:
- Total number of users
- Pending GDPR requests
- Data export requests (last 30 days)
- Data deletion requests (last 30 days)

### 5. Audit Logging

All GDPR-related actions are logged:
- Data exports
- Data deletions
- Account deletions
- Privacy policy changes

## How to Use

### For Data Export Requests
Your existing `/api/gdpr-export` endpoint will now:
1. Log the request in `gdpr_requests` table
2. Use `export_user_data()` function to get all user data
3. Return structured JSON with all user information

### For Account Deletion
Your delete account feature will now:
1. Log the deletion request
2. Use `delete_user_data()` function to remove all data
3. Create audit trail for compliance

### For Data Cleanup
Run this manually or set up a cron job:
```sql
SELECT public.cleanup_expired_data();
```

### For Compliance Monitoring
Check if you're meeting retention requirements:
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.check_retention_compliance();
```

## Important Notes

1. **Test First**: Run this on a development database first
2. **Backup**: Make sure you have backups before running
3. **Monitor**: Check the audit logs regularly
4. **Update**: Review and update retention periods as needed
